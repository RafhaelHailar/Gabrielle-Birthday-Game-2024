  A kid friendly, simple story, and multi game type, that I made for my little sister named Gabriella on her birthday in the year of 2024.

  It is a game about what characteristics a strong kid have, and shows the effects on what will happen if you have less of those characteristics, how will affect your gameplay as you progress to different games.
